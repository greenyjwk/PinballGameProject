  Using the reaollocate to allocate memory was very interesting experience, since In the Java concents we have never
 controlled and also did not have to control the memory which is more like low level concept. We could have experience 
to touch the computer memory manually which was really interesting.

  when I ran this file with command line, I should put the 'control d ' which makes the program assume the input file is 
end of file. And the command I used, 'cat < testdata > output 2> errors', it means that the program uses the input data with 
'test' coming after <, and also it prints the results at the file "output' and prints the error messages at the file 'errors' coming after 2>.

 I use first argument of fprintf as stederr, which makes the error messages go to standard output such as file, console or screen. 
The error messages happened when a ball hits the wall and when a ball falls off a table.


I use standard output, and it defaults to the user's screen and I did not change the output method, the if I try to make output file,
it is same as screen output. output file prints out location and velocity information of all balls in the table per every seconds.
