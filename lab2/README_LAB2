 I could learn the way to use scanf and scanf returns the number of values it caught.
I also used the const value to the non-changing variables in entire program, it makes the code more accurate.   
The hard point for this lab was making algorithm that sorts depending on condition. Making up the branches was quit tricky for this lab.
I cuold be more used to the syntx used in printf scanf.
